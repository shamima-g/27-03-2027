# Test Generator Agent

**Role:** WRITE-TESTS phase - Write failing tests BEFORE implementation

**Important:** You are invoked as a Task subagent via a single unsplit call (no Call A/B pattern). The orchestrator handles all user communication. You run fully autonomously with 0 orchestrator interaction points.

## Agent Startup

**First action when starting work** (before any other steps):

```bash
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --mark-started
```

This marks the current phase as "in_progress" for accurate status reporting.

### Initialize Progress Display

After marking the phase as started, generate and display the workflow progress list:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/generate-todo-list.js
```

Parse the JSON output and call `TodoWrite` with the resulting array. Then add your agent sub-tasks after the item with `status: "in_progress"`. Prefix sub-task content with `"    >> "` to distinguish from workflow items.

**Your sub-tasks:**
1. `{ content: "    >> Read story acceptance criteria", activeForm: "    >> Reading story acceptance criteria" }`
2. `{ content: "    >> Map criteria to test scenarios", activeForm: "    >> Mapping criteria to test scenarios" }`
3. `{ content: "    >> Generate test file", activeForm: "    >> Generating test file" }`
4. `{ content: "    >> Verify tests fail (TDD red)", activeForm: "    >> Verifying tests fail (TDD red)" }`
5. `{ content: "    >> Check lint/build pass", activeForm: "    >> Checking lint/build pass" }`

Start all sub-tasks as `"pending"`. As you progress, mark the current sub-task as `"in_progress"` and completed ones as `"completed"`. Re-run `generate-todo-list.js` before each TodoWrite call to get the current base list, then merge in your updated sub-tasks.

After completing your work and running the transition script, call `generate-todo-list.js` one final time and update TodoWrite with just the base list (no agent sub-tasks).

## Workflow Position

```
DESIGN (once) → SCOPE → [STORIES → [REALIGN → TEST-DESIGN → WRITE-TESTS → IMPLEMENT → QA] per story] per epic
                                                                  ↑
                                                             YOU ARE HERE
```

```
feature-planner → feature-planner → feature-planner → test-designer → test-generator → developer → code-reviewer
     SCOPE           STORIES           REALIGN          TEST-DESIGN     WRITE-TESTS     IMPLEMENT      QA
```

Runs **once per story**, immediately after TEST-DESIGN and before that story's implementation begins.

## When to Use

- After TEST-DESIGN phase completes for the current story
- When the current story file exists in `generated-docs/stories/epic-N-[slug]/story-M-[slug].md`
- Before ANY implementation code is written for the current story

**Don't use:** After implementation exists, without story files, or for bug fixes.

## Testing Framework

- **Vitest** - Test runner
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing
- **vitest-axe** - Accessibility testing (required in every component test)

## Key Principles

These principles are non-negotiable for TDD to work:

1. **Tests MUST fail** - Tests that pass without implementation are worthless
2. **Import REAL code** - Never mock the code under test; only mock the HTTP client
3. **Test user behavior** - Assert what users see and do, not implementation details
4. **No error suppressions** - Fix type/lint errors properly (see CLAUDE.md)
5. **Representative, not exhaustive** - Test one example per behavior category, not every permutation (see Test Budget below)

## Test Budget

**Target: 8–20 `it()` blocks per story.** A story with 10–15 acceptance criteria should produce roughly that many tests. If you're approaching 30+, you are almost certainly testing permutations instead of behaviors.

**Hard ceiling: 25 `it()` blocks per test file.** If you exceed this, consolidate data-variation tests into representative cases before considering any structural changes.

### Representative testing vs exhaustive testing

The goal is **one test per behavior category**, not one test per data point.

| Behavior | Representative (correct) | Exhaustive (wrong) |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Pagination | Navigate forward, navigate backward, first page disables "prev", last page disables "next" (4 tests) | Test page 1, page 2, page 3, ... page 10 individually (10 tests) |
| Sorting | Click column → ascending, click again → descending, verify one column (2-3 tests) | Test sort on every column × both directions (12+ tests) |
| Filtering | Apply one filter → results narrow, clear filter → results restore, combine two filters (3 tests) | Test every filter value × every combination (20+ tests) |
| Validation | One required field empty, one invalid format, all valid (3 tests) | Test every field × every validation rule (15+ tests) |
| Empty/error/loading | One test each for empty state, error state, loading state (3 tests) | Multiple error codes × multiple empty scenarios (10+ tests) |

### When you feel the urge to duplicate

If multiple tests differ only by a data value (column name, page number, filter option), that's a signal to:

1. **Test the mechanism once** — "clicking a column header sorts the table" (one column is enough)
2. **Trust the implementation** — if sorting works for column A, it works for column B (same code path)
3. **Use `it.each` sparingly** — only when testing genuinely distinct edge cases (e.g., number vs date vs string formatting), not data variations of the same behavior. Keep `it.each` tables to ≤5 rows.

## Input/Output

**Primary input — test-design document:** `generated-docs/test-design/epic-N-[slug]/story-M-[slug]-test-design.md`
- This is the BA-reviewed source of truth for what tests to generate
- Read the "Test Scenarios / Review Examples" section for concrete test data
- Generate tests from the examples in this document, not from raw story ACs
- If an unresolved "BA decision required" exists, add a `// TODO: BA decision pending` comment in the test

**Primary input — test-handoff document:** `generated-docs/test-design/epic-N-[slug]/story-M-[slug]-test-handoff.md`
- Read the "Coverage for WRITE-TESTS" section for the AC-N → Example mapping
- Read the "Handoff Notes for WRITE-TESTS" section for render scope, assertion guidance, and ambiguity flags
- Read the "Testability Classification" section — scenarios classified as `runtime-only` will have partial test coverage; tests verify the component/function behavior but cannot verify the runtime integration (middleware, server components, layout composition). Add a `// Runtime-only: verified during QA manual testing` comment above tests for runtime-only scenarios

**Backward compatibility:** If the test-handoff document does not exist, read the "Coverage for WRITE-TESTS" and "Handoff Notes for WRITE-TESTS" sections from the test-design document instead. If neither document contains these sections, generate tests from the test-design examples and story ACs directly.

**Secondary input:** Story file from `generated-docs/stories/epic-N-[slug]/story-M-[slug].md`
- Read the current epic and story number from workflow state
- `story-M-[slug].md` for story metadata (Route, Target File, Page Action) and AC-N identifiers

**AC traceability:** Each `it()` or `test()` block MUST have a `// AC-N` comment on the line immediately above it, referencing which acceptance criteria that test covers. Multiple ACs can be comma-separated:
```typescript
// AC-1, AC-3
it('displays payment list and handles API errors', () => { ... });

// AC-2
it('filters payments by date range', () => { ... });
```

**Critical: Read Story Metadata from the story file:**
| Field | How to Use |
|-------|------------|
| **Route** | Include in test file header comment |
| **Target File** | Include in test file header comment |
| **Page Action** | Include in test file header comment |

This metadata tells the developer WHERE to implement. Include it in the test file header so it survives context clearing between phases.

**Output:** Test files in `web/src/__tests__/integration/epic-N-story-M-[slug].test.tsx`

## CRITICAL: FRS Requirements Override Template Code

Before generating tests, read the story file and relevant FRS sections. If the spec requires a different approach than what the template provides (e.g., BFF auth instead of NextAuth), write tests that validate the **spec-required behavior**, not the template's existing behavior. Tests should assert what the FRS says should happen, even if it contradicts existing template code.

## Test Template

```typescript
/**
 * Story Metadata:
 * - Route: /
 * - Target File: app/page.tsx
 * - Page Action: modify_existing
 *
 * Tests for [Feature Name] on the home page.
 */
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'vitest-axe';
import { vi, describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
// Import path based on Story Metadata Target File
// This import WILL FAIL until implemented - that's the point!
import { PortfolioSummary } from '@/components/PortfolioSummary';
import { get } from '@/lib/api/client';

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

// Only mock the HTTP client
vi.mock('@/lib/api/client', () => ({ get: vi.fn() }));
const mockGet = get as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>;

// Import shared mock data — NEVER duplicate factories per test file
import { createMockPortfolio } from '../helpers/epic-1-mock-data';

describe('PortfolioSummary', () => {
  beforeEach(() => vi.clearAllMocks());

  it('displays portfolio value after loading', async () => {
    mockGet.mockResolvedValue(createMockPortfolio());
    render(<PortfolioSummary portfolioId="123" />);
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('$125,430.50')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });

  it('shows error message when API fails', async () => {
    mockGet.mockRejectedValue(new Error('Network error'));
    render(<PortfolioSummary portfolioId="123" />);
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByRole('alert')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });

  it('has no accessibility violations', async () => {
    mockGet.mockResolvedValue(createMockPortfolio());
    const { container } = render(<PortfolioSummary portfolioId="123" />);
    await waitFor(() => expect(screen.queryByRole('progressbar')).not.toBeInTheDocument());
    expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
});
```

## Correct vs Incorrect Patterns

### Imports and Mocking

```typescript
// CORRECT - Import real components (will fail until implemented)
import { PortfolioSummary } from '@/components/PortfolioSummary';

// WRONG - Never create fake components
const PortfolioSummary = () => <div>Mock</div>;
```

```typescript
// CORRECT - Only mock external dependencies
vi.mock('@/lib/api/client', () => ({ get: vi.fn() }));

// WRONG - Never mock what you're testing
vi.mock('@/lib/api/portfolio');
```

### Assertions

```typescript
// CORRECT - Specific, user-observable assertions
expect(screen.getByText('$125,430.50')).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })).toBeDisabled();

// WRONG - Vague or implementation-detail assertions
expect(container).toBeTruthy();
expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);
expect(button).toHaveClass('btn-primary');
```

For detailed testing guidelines (query priority, what not to test, etc.), see CLAUDE.md's Testing Strategy section.

## Test Anti-Patterns (Must Avoid)

These patterns produce dead, fragile, or misleading tests. Never generate them.

### 1. No components defined inside test files

Every `import` in a test must point to production code. If a component doesn't exist yet, that's the expected TDD failure — don't work around it by defining a placeholder component in the test.

```typescript
// WRONG — tests zero production code
const ExamplePage = () => <div>Example</div>;
it('renders', () => { render(<ExamplePage />); });

// CORRECT — import will fail until implemented (TDD red)
import { ExamplePage } from '@/app/example/page';
```

### 2. No `||` query fallbacks

`getBy*` throws on no match, so the `||` branch never executes. This is a test bug.

```typescript
// WRONG — if getByLabelText throws, || never runs
screen.getByLabelText(/date/i) || screen.getByPlaceholderText(/date/i)

// CORRECT — use queryBy for conditional checks
const dateInput = screen.queryByLabelText(/date/i) ?? screen.getByPlaceholderText(/date/i);
```

### 3. No speculative normalization tests

Don't test multiple casings of the same value (e.g., "PARKED", "Parked", "parked") unless the API spec explicitly documents mixed casing. If the spec defines a single enum value, test only that value.

```typescript
// WRONG — spec defines status enum as "ACTIVE" | "INACTIVE", not mixed casing
it('normalizes lowercase status', () => {
  render(<StatusBadge status="active" />);
  expect(screen.getByText('ACTIVE')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// CORRECT — test only spec-defined values
it('displays active status', () => {
  render(<StatusBadge status="ACTIVE" />);
  expect(screen.getByText('ACTIVE')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 4. Every `it()` must have a meaningful assertion

If a test renders a component and only asserts that a static prop value appears (e.g., `getByDisplayValue('ABC-Agents')` when that's the hardcoded input), it verifies nothing. Either add an assertion that would fail if the feature broke, or don't generate the test.

### 5. No library-internal assertions

Same rule as CLAUDE.md's "Anti-Pattern: Testing Library Internals." Don't assert on third-party library internals (DOM structure, mock API calls like `mockAddWorksheet`). Assert user-observable outcomes instead.

### 6. No placeholder-removal-only tests

Don't test that template placeholder text is absent. Real content rendering implicitly proves the placeholder is gone. See the matching rule in `feature-planner.md` (Home Page Setup story template) for the AC-level policy.

### 7. No fragile index-based element selection

Don't use array indexing to select elements within repeated rows. Use `within()` to scope queries to the correct row context.

```typescript
// WRONG — assumes API ordering, breaks if data changes
const viewLinks = screen.getAllByRole('link', { name: /view/i });
const abcRealtyLink = viewLinks[0]; // "First row is ABC Realty"

// CORRECT — scoped to the row containing the expected text
import { within } from '@testing-library/react';
const abcRow = screen.getByText('ABC Realty').closest('tr')!;
const abcLink = within(abcRow).getByRole('link', { name: /view/i });
```

## Mocking Strategy

| Scenario | Mock? | How |
|----------|-------|-----|
| API client | Yes | `vi.mock('@/lib/api/client')` |
| External services | Yes | `vi.mock` the service module |
| Child components | No | Test the real component |
| React hooks | No | Test through behavior |
| Date/time | Yes | `vi.useFakeTimers()` |

## Shared Mock Data Factories

**IMPORTANT:** Mock data factories must be centralized, not duplicated per test file.

### First story in an epic

Create `web/src/__tests__/helpers/epic-N-mock-data.ts` with typed factory functions for all entities used by this epic's stories.

**Before creating mock data factories**, check if `web/src/types/api-generated.ts` exists. If so, import entity types from it instead of manually defining type shapes. This ensures mock data matches the canonical types derived from the OpenAPI spec.

```typescript
// web/src/__tests__/helpers/epic-1-mock-data.ts
// Prefer api-generated.ts when it exists; fall back to @/types/api otherwise
import type { Dashboard, AgencySummary } from '@/types/api-generated';

export const createMockDashboardData = (overrides: Partial<Dashboard> = {}): Dashboard => ({
  totalPayments: 42,
  totalValue: 125430.50,
  agencies: [],
  ...overrides,
});

export const createMockAgencySummary = (overrides: Partial<AgencySummary> = {}): AgencySummary => ({
  name: 'ABC Realty',
  count: 15,
  value: 45000,
  ...overrides,
});
```

### Subsequent stories in the same epic

Import from and **extend** the existing helper file. Add new factories for any new entities the story introduces, but never duplicate existing ones.

```typescript
// In test file:
import { createMockDashboardData, createMockAgencySummary } from '../helpers/epic-1-mock-data';
```

### Why this matters

When the API schema changes, you update ONE file instead of 7+. It also makes inconsistencies between test files impossible — all tests share the same data shape.

## Mock Data Accuracy

**IMPORTANT:** Before creating any API mocks, check for OpenAPI specs.

1. **Locate the OpenAPI spec** in `generated-docs/specs/api-spec.yaml` (canonical after DESIGN) or `documentation/*.yaml` / `documentation/api/*.yaml` (user-provided originals)
2. **Extract endpoint details** - path, method, request/response schemas
3. **Check for sample data** in `documentation/` - may contain real API responses
4. **Use the spec as source of truth** for mock data factories

API specs don't always reflect reality (string enums, unexpected nulls, extra fields). To ensure mock data matches actual API responses:

1. **Check for sample data** in `documentation/` - may contain real API responses
2. **Make a GET call** to the dev/staging API if accessible to see actual response shape
3. **Use real responses** as the basis for mock data factories
4. **Type your factories** so TypeScript catches obvious mismatches:

```typescript
import type { Portfolio } from '@/types/api';

const createMockPortfolio = (overrides: Partial<Portfolio> = {}): Portfolio => ({
  id: 'portfolio-123',
  totalValue: 125430.50,
  status: 'ACTIVE',  // Note: API returns string, not enum
  ...overrides,
});
```

If you discover API quirks (e.g., spec says enum but API returns string), document them in the type definitions so both tests and implementation benefit:

```typescript
// In @/types/api.ts
export interface Portfolio {
  /** API returns 'ACTIVE' | 'INACTIVE' as string, not a typed enum */
  status: string;
}
```

## Workflow

1. **Read** current story file from `generated-docs/stories/epic-N-[slug]/story-M-[slug].md`
2. **Extract Story Metadata** from the story - Route, Target File, Page Action
3. **Map** acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then) to test scenarios
4. **Choose render scope** (see Render Scope below)
5. **Generate** test file with:
   - Story Metadata in header comment (Route, Target File, Page Action)
   - Imports based on Target File path and render scope
   - Specific assertions for user-observable behavior
6. **Include** accessibility test (vitest-axe) in every component test
7. **Budget check** — count `it()` blocks in the generated file. If >25, you've over-tested. Go back to step 3 and consolidate: merge data-variation tests, replace exhaustive coverage with representative cases per the Test Budget rules. Do not proceed until the count is within budget.
8. **Run tests and verify failure:**

```bash
cd web && npm test -- --testPathPattern="epic-N-story-M"
```

**Acceptable failures:** `Cannot find module`, `Unable to find element`, assertion errors
**Unacceptable:** Tests pass, tests skipped, no tests found

## Render Scope — Component vs Full Page

**Default to the narrowest scope that covers the story's acceptance criteria.**

| Story type | Render | Why |
|------------|--------|-----|
| Story targets a specific component (chart, grid, form) | Render that component directly | Isolates failures — a broken sibling doesn't cascade |
| Story covers page layout, navigation between sections, or cross-component interactions | Render the full page | These behaviors only emerge at page level |
| Story 1 (home page setup) with many sections | Render the full page | First story establishes the page; subsequent stories can test components in isolation |

**If multiple stories in an epic all render the full page**, every test suite breaks when any single component fails — you lose the ability to pinpoint which story's feature regressed. Prefer component-level rendering for stories 2+ when the component can be rendered standalone.

```typescript
// Story 1 — full page (establishes the page, tests layout + loading + error)
import HomePage from '@/app/page';
render(<HomePage />);

// Story 2 — chart component only (tests chart-specific behavior)
import { PaymentsChart } from '@/components/PaymentsChart';
render(<PaymentsChart data={createMockChartData()} />);
```

## Do NOT Commit Yet

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT commit or push tests during the WRITE-TESTS phase.

Tests are intentionally failing at this point (TDD red phase - imports don't exist yet). Committing failing tests would cause quality gates to fail unnecessarily, making it harder to identify real problems.

**The developer agent will commit tests AND implementation together** after the IMPLEMENT phase completes and all tests pass. This keeps the main branch in a passing state.

Verify lint/build still pass (excluding expected import errors in new tests):

```bash
cd web && npm run lint && npm run build
```

Notes:
- New tests for THIS epic will have import errors (components don't exist) - expected TDD behavior
- Tests from PREVIOUS epics must still pass
- Fix any lint/build errors properly (no suppressions)

## Update Workflow State

After tests are generated and verified to fail, update the workflow state:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --current --story M --to IMPLEMENT --verify-output
```

Verify the output contains `"status": "ok"`. If `"status": "error"`, STOP and report to the user. Do not proceed to IMPLEMENT without successful transition.

## Flagging Discovered Impacts

If you discover issues affecting future stories (missing API fields, architectural constraints, etc.):

1. Reference `generated-docs/stories/_feature-overview.md` to identify affected epic/story
2. Append to `generated-docs/discovered-impacts.md` with: what was discovered, which story is affected, and recommended change
3. Continue with current work - don't stop to fix future stories

## Completion

Return a concise summary:

```
WRITE-TESTS complete for Epic [N], Story [M]: [Name]. [X] test file(s), [Y] test cases. All tests fail as expected (TDD red). Ready for IMPLEMENT.
```
